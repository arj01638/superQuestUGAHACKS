## Inspiration
I like to roleplay with ChatGPT sometimes as a creative outlet, so I figured a text adventure game would be fun, especially one where you had to rack your brain on how to solve problems using a really niche superpower.

## What it does
You are given a scenario to solve, a niche superpower, and then you are engaged in conversation to try to solve it. The program can detect when you win/lose. You can rewind one time at any point, and you earn rewinds with victories.

## How we built it
It's written in Python so I used Kivy for the GUI and gpt4free for the AI backend. All the images and backend prompts were made by me.

## Challenges we ran into
Kivy was just some nonsense to get a hold of.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It's simple and small, but for one person I'm proud that it actually works and is kinda fun to play.

## What we learned
I learned that a seemingly super tiny project can end up taking hours.

## What's next for Super Quest
It will sit on my GitHub as resume fodder.

## How to run
You can import this project and install kivy/gpt4free and run main
